# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Project Description: Churn Modelling with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. By accurately identifying customers who are likely to churn, businesses can implement proactive retention strategies and reduce customer attrition.

Significance:
Customer churn has a direct impact on a company's revenue and growth. This project helps businesses improve retention by leveraging data-driven insights. The use of an ANN model allows for the capturing of complex patterns in the data, making it a highly effective method for churn prediction.

Project Workflow:

ETL Process: Extraction, transformation, and loading of customer data.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the key drivers of churn.
Model Building: Developing an ANN using Keras and TensorFlow for churn prediction.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation.
Outcome: Achieved an accuracy of 85.47%, which can help businesses predict and manage customer churn effectively.
Tools & Libraries Used:

Python
Pandas, Numpy (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Preprocessing & Model Evaluation)
TensorFlow / Keras (Model Building)
